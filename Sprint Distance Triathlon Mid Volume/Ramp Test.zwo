    <description>The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but demanding, continuous effort.&nbsp;The first half of the workout takes place at low enough&nbsp;intensities that you should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and hang in there for as long as you can.Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative that you really push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.&nbsp;There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will influence your new FTP estimate. Every second counts.Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence. Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the&nbsp;goal power any longer. The&nbsp;test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.Good luck, ride hard!

By following a tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess/reassess possible changes in fitness at any time of their training season.This short effort attempts to use a demonstration of your maximum incremental capabilities&nbsp;to ballpark your FTP, once reduced.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be reasonably rested and properly motivated so you can put forth a true all-out effort during those final, very important minutes.</description>
