    <description>Rubicon -2 is 3x10-minute intervals at 105% FTP with 5-minute recoveries between intervals. While this can serve as a recovery workout, it also works as a low-volume suprathreshold workout.

The goal of slightly suprathreshold workouts is to extend high power over greater durations. By riding only slightly above your current FTP, you'll become accustomed - both physically and mentally - to a workload just beyond your current sustainable reach. These intervals are also an ideal time to begin bridging the gap between power in an upright riding position and power in an aerodynamic position.Strive to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.</description>
