    <description>White +5 is 2 sets of 50 continuous minutes of Tempo work each broken into 5x10-minute segments ranging from 70-80% FTP.

Tempo rides are the height of aerobic endurance and while rather uncomfortable, they aren't too stressful to keep you from spending pretty long durations at a productive work level that isn't too demanding in terms of recovery.This is where many ultra-distance triathletes will live for hours at a time. This is also where a lot of time is spent during any long road ride.Use portions or entireties of these intervals to work on riding in your aerodynamic position without sacrificing power.There is no scheduled rest during these sets, but brief, occasional backspins are encouraged if they're the difference between loss of form and a high-quality workout.







Try to do so with a cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 90rpm.</description>
