    <description>Byers Peak -4 is 3x12-minute intervals between 95-99% FTP with 5-minute recoveries between each.

The primary objective here is improvements in muscular endurance accomplished by growing your ability to repeat efforts at near-FTP wattages.By working close to but below your FTP, you not only accumulate a lot of time at a meaningful level of stress, but recovery from slightly sub-threshold effort comes a bit more readily than recovery following supra-FTP work.Try to hold your spin above 85rpm and even as high as 105rpm depending on your sustainable power and cadence goals.</description>
