    <name>z - 2x20 Minute Test</name>
    <description>FTP assessment consisting of 2x20-minute intervals with only 2 minutes of rest between intervals. FTP is calculated as the average power from the two 20-minute intervals. This workout will not generate an FTP for you, you must do the calcuation yourself.&nbsp;

This workout offers an alternate method of estimating FTP and can also serve as a means of confirming a recent, more formal assessment workout like the 8 Minute Test or the 20 Minute Test. This workout functions as a check for confirmation of your FTP, but does not give you an FTP upon completion.&nbsp;As assessment, simply try to sustain your highest output possible keeping in mind that you?ll have to repeat the effort after a very brief recovery interval.As a confirmation workout, riding both intervals at 102% FTP can serve as a good indication that your recent assessment was a reasonably accurate estimate of your maximal sustainable power.</description>
