    <description>Round Bald -1 is 3x15-minute intervals at 85% FTP with 5-minute recoveries between intervals. 

The primary aim of Sweet Spot work is to improve your ability to resist fatigue at reasonably high power outputs over substantial lengths of time.In other words, workouts like this are all about increasing your muscular endurance.In doing so, you can improve your ability to climb faster and longer, face stiff winds without fading and time trial more consistently over the entire course of an event. Additionally, you have the option of targeting specific aspects of pedaling technique as well as your climbing technique, both seated and standing.Cadence recommendations vary depending on the current drill, but riders choosing to omit the drills should aim for a spin between above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.</description>
