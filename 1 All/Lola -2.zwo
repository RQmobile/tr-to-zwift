    <description>Lola -2 is an even more toned down 30-minute effort well below your current FTP.The first 10% of the time trial duration will bring you to the power you'll try to hold for the remainder of the long interval.

The goals of tune-up time trials are two-fold: 1 - Grow more accustomed to working at the height of your sustainable power for an increasingly longer span of time.2 - Assess improvements in FTP based on your time trial and more importantly your perceived exertion.</description>
