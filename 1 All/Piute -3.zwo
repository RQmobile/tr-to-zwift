    <name>Piute -3</name>
    <description>Piute -3 is marginally less punishing than its -2 version since the short recovery valleys have grown to a full minute in duration in order to allow you to shed a little more fatigue prior to start each new step.Each 10% step lasts 12 minute and starts at 60% FTP and then progresses the workload up to 100% FTP during the final step. 

The muscular endurance intervals in this particular sequence of workouts - consisting of Rendezvous, Piute, Ragged &amp; Tower - grow in duration each workout via slightly longer steps. Progression Workouts ever so gradually increase the power requirement until you are working at your Functional Threshold Power, all in an effort to raise that maximum steady-state pace, your ability to withstand increasing physical discomfort, and your time to exhaustion.Do your best to keep your cadence in that 85-95rpm range with each upward step in power output, and spend greater lengths of time in your aero position even as the power requirements grow.</description>
